## Future steps
While this project began as a passionate hobby, it stemmed from a deep curiosity about NFTs. As we look towards the future, several intriguing avenues for development come to mind:

-   **Validation and Certification**: One intriguing prospect is the integration of a robust validation system that affirms the identity of the individual placing an order for a printed NFT. This validation could be achieved through ArtBridger's own certification mechanism, underscoring the tangible connection between the digital NFT and its physical rendition. Alternatively, a novel NFT could be generated upon the successful completion of the checkout process, attesting to the ownership of the printed artwork.

-   **Third-Party Fulfillment Integration**: Expanding the project's horizons, the incorporation of a third-party entity for order fulfillment presents an exciting opportunity. By collaborating with a reliable third party, the printing and delivery process could be streamlined, ensuring a seamless experience for users as their digital art takes on a tangible form.
